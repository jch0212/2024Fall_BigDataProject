The project contaians three parts that was completed seperately by different teamates.

# Part 1 by Jiahui Zhu: Urban Zoning Visualization, and Project Life Cycle analysis

Step 1: 
    Purpose: 
        To trim datasouce so that it can fit into course shared Jupyter Notebook environmet (limited memory) in Step 2.
    Environment: 
        NYU Dataproc
    Input file: 
        under https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skDuhQt2xQXZehsV7X0nEeWBx2AoVBAS?usp=sharing
        input/DOB_Job_Application_Filings_20240424.csv
    Output file: under https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skDuhQt2xQXZehsV7X0nEeWBx2AoVBAS?usp=sharing
        output/dob_nyc_project.csv
    Script file: 
        part1_jz5584/pre_process.py
    Steps: 
        Do not modify input file name. 
        Put input file and script file under the same directory. 
        Run "python pre_process.py". 
        Output file will be generated under the same directly.
Step 2:
    Purpose: 
        To perform analysis on the datasource.
    Environment: 
        couser shared Jupyter Notebook - https://csgy-6513-spring.rcnyu.org/user/jz5584/tree/jz5584_project
    Input file: 
        under https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skDuhQt2xQXZehsV7X0nEeWBx2AoVBAS?usp=sharing

        output/jz5584_project_final.pdf (Jupyter Notebook script with output)
    Script file: part1_jz5584/jz5584_project_final.ipynb
    Steps: 
        Do not modify input file name. 
        Put input file and script file under the same Jupyter Noterbook directory. 
        Run the script file. Output file will be generated under the same directly.
