# 2024Fall_BigDataProject

The project contains three parts that were completed separately by different teammates.

## Part 1 by Jiahui Zhu: Urban Zoning Visualization and Project Life Cycle Analysis

### Step 1:

- **Purpose**: To trim the datasource so that it can fit into the course's shared Jupyter Notebook environment (limited memory) in Step 2.
- **Environment**: NYU Dataproc
- **Input file**: [DOB_Job_Application_Filings_20240424.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skDuhQt2xQXZehsV7X0nEeWBx2AoVBAS?usp=sharing/input/DOB_Job_Application_Filings_20240424.csv)
- **Output file**: [dob_nyc_project.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1skDuhQt2xQXZehsV7X0nEeWBx2AoVBAS?usp=sharing/output/dob_nyc_project.csv)
- **Script file**: `part1_jz5584/pre_process.py`
- **Steps**:
  1. Do not modify the input file name.
  2. Put the input file and script file under the same directory.
  3. Run `python pre_process.py`.
  4. Output file will be generated under the same directory.

### Step 2:

- **Purpose**: To perform analysis on the datasource.
- **Environment**: Course shared Jupyter Notebook - [Link](https://csgy-6513-spring.rcnyu.org/user/jz5584/tree/jz5584_project)
